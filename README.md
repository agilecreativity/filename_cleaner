Quickly rename list of files with extension and replace any special characters with
with any given string.

Currently any string that are not one of letters (a..z, A..Z),
numbers (0..9), _ (underscore), - (dash), and ' ' spaces string
are first squeezed into one string and then replaced by any given string/char [default to . (a single dot)].
